# Off The Shelf Studios E-Commerce Website Pattern library

Off The Shelf was originally a small pottery and ceramics studio with only a few resident artists that has quickly grown in size. Their products are in high demand and they decided to ask me to create a website for them that accurately reflects their unique brand and style.

A simple, modern design was used to reflect their clean and modern studio. It also puts focus solely on the products and works of art being showcased on this website.

## Installation
